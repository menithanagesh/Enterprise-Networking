# Enterprise Networking Project (Cisco Packet Tracer)

## Overview
This project demonstrates the **design and implementation of an Enterprise Network** using Cisco Packet Tracer.  
It is built following a **Hierarchical Network Design model** (Core, Distribution, and Access layers) and integrates multiple enterprise-level networking concepts.

## Technologies Implemented
- Hierarchical Network Design (Core / Distribution / Access layers)
- VLANs and Inter-VLAN Routing (using Switch Virtual Interfaces - SVI)
- DHCP Server for automatic IP allocation
- Static IPv4 addressing for critical devices
- Port Security on Switches
- Secure remote device management using SSH
- NAT Overload (PAT) for Internet access
- Access Control Lists (ACLs) for traffic filtering
- Wireless LAN (WLAN) with Access Point configuration

## Requirements
- Cisco Packet Tracer (version 8.x or higher recommended)
- Basic to intermediate knowledge of networking concepts (VLANs, routing, ACLs, DHCP, etc.)

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/menithanagesh/Enterprise-Network-CPT.git
2. [Download Packet Tracer File](cisco project.pkt)
